# London‐Housing‐Price‐Model 2023–2024

This repository holds a Jupyter notebook that walks through a complete data pipeline for predicting London house prices in 2023–2024. Below is what you’ll find:

- **Data Cleaning**  
  We begin by keeping only 2023–24 sales and thoughtfully filling or dropping missing values so that every variable is ready for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Visualizations reveal how prices distribute across London, compare by property type (in £ millions), and highlight the top 10 most expensive postcodes.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  To give our model more insight, we create:
  - `beds_per_sqm` and `baths_per_sqm` (showing how efficiently space is used)  
  - `area_sq` (to capture diminishing returns of size)  
  - `dist_center_km` (straight‐line distance to Charing Cross, spotting the city‐centre premium)

- **Modeling**  
  We fit a straightforward OLS regression first. Then, to address multicollinearity and improve stability, we run:
  - **RidgeCV**  
  - **LassoCV**  
  - **ElasticNetCV**

- **Evaluation**  
  A 5‐fold cross‐validation shows a Test R² of around 0.84 and an average error (MAE) of about £ 156 k. We also validate these results on a held‐out test set.

# 🏙️ London Housing Price Model (2023–2024)

**A full end-to-end data science project on London’s housing market — from raw data to business insights.**

London’s property market is famously unpredictable. Prices can jump dramatically within just a few streets, and traditional metrics like “number of bedrooms” often fail to explain why two similar homes sell for very different prices.

In this project, I set out to answer a practical business question:

> **What actually drives house prices in London today — and can we model it reliably at scale?**

To answer this, I built a complete data pipeline using **~200,000 real London property listings**, applied thoughtful **feature engineering**, and compared **OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression models** to balance interpretability, stability, and predictive power.

This repository showcases how I approach **real-world data problems**: cleaning messy datasets, engineering meaningful features, validating models properly, and translating results into **clear business insights**.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Kaggle — *London House Price Data*  
- **Coverage:** ~418,000 records (1995–2024)  
- **Final modeling window:** **2023–2024 only**
- **Key attributes:**  
  - Location (postcode, latitude, longitude)  
  - Property characteristics (size, bedrooms, bathrooms, tenure, energy rating)  
  - Sale price estimates and historical transaction data  

### Why I Focused on 2023–2024

London prices from the 1990s or early 2000s no longer reflect today’s market reality. Including them would bias the model and weaken business relevance.

So I:
- Extracted the sale year
- Filtered the dataset down to **recent transactions only**
- Reduced noise while keeping **~197,000 high-quality records**

This ensures the model learns **modern buyer behavior**, not outdated price dynamics.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Working with a large real-world dataset means dealing with missing, inconsistent, and irrelevant data.

### What I Did

- **Dropped irrelevant features** (e.g. rent estimates when predicting sale prices)
- **Handled missing values strategically**:
  - Numeric features → filled with medians
  - Categorical features → filled with mode
- **Removed overly sparse variables** (≈40% missing)
- Verified **no duplicate records**

📌 Result:  
A clean, modeling-ready dataset with **197,000+ rows and zero missing values**.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helped translate raw data into intuition.

### Key Observations

- **Most London homes sell between £0.4 and £0.9 million**
- A small number of **multi-million-pound properties** create strong right-skew
- Clear price tiering by **property type**
- Strong postcode-driven price clustering

### Notable Insights

- Flats dominate the lower price bands
- Detached and semi-detached homes occupy premium tiers
- Central London outcodes (e.g. SW1X, W1K, W8) command **2–4× higher prices**

These insights directly informed later feature engineering and modeling choices.

## 🧠 Feature Engineering (Where the Real Value Is)

Instead of relying only on raw columns, I engineered features that reflect **how buyers think**.

### Key Engineered Features

- **beds_per_sqm**  
  Captures space efficiency — small, dense flats often trade at a premium.

- **baths_per_sqm**  
  Extra bathrooms in limited space often signal luxury.

- **area_sq (floorArea²)**  
  Allows the model to learn **diminishing returns** on very large homes.

- **dist_center_km**  
  Straight-line distance from Charing Cross — a strong proxy for the “Central London premium”.

- **Energy rating (ordinal encoding)**  
  Turns EPC ratings into an ordered efficiency signal.

📌 These features significantly improved model stability and interpretability.

## 🤖 Modeling Approach

I framed this as a **regression problem**, predicting **log(price)** to handle skew and outliers.

### Models Tested

- **OLS (Baseline)**
- **Ridge Regression (Regularized)**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **ElasticNet**

### Validation Strategy

- **5-fold cross-validation**
- **Hold-out test set**

**Metrics:**
- R² (explained variance)
- MAE (mean absolute error, in £)

## 📈 Model Performance (Real-World Interpretable)

| Model | Test R² | Test MAE (£) | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|------|
| **OLS** | ~0.84 | ~£156k | Strong but multicollinearity present |
| **Ridge (Final)** | **0.83** | **£163k** | Best balance of accuracy & stability |
| Lasso | ~0.79 | £188k | Too aggressive, lost signal |
| ElasticNet | ~0.83 | £165k | Behaves like Ridge |

📌 **Ridge regression performed best overall**, maintaining high accuracy while handling correlated features gracefully.

## 📌 Business Insights (What Recruiters Care About)

This model isn’t just accurate — it tells a clear story:

- 📐 **Floor area is the strongest price driver**
- 🚿 **Bathrooms add value beyond size**
- 📍 **Every 1 km closer to Charing Cross ≈ ~5% higher price**
- 🏢 **Flats consistently underperform houses**
- 🏙️ **Prime postcodes can double prices**
- 📉 **Very large homes show diminishing returns**

These insights can directly inform:
- Pricing strategy
- Investment decisions
- Location-based forecasting
- Policy and urban planning analysis

---

## 🧪 Diagnostics & Model Reliability

I validated assumptions thoroughly:

- Residuals show **no systematic bias**
- Errors remain stable across price ranges
- Q–Q plots show near-normal residuals
- No signs of overfitting

This is a **production-ready modeling approach**, not just a notebook experiment.
